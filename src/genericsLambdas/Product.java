		//Add as many products as you want to your Inventory Object using the addItem() method you defined 


		//Your task is to calculate the total price of all products in an Inventory object called myInventory. Follow these steps:
		//1. Call the getItems method on your inventory object to retrieve the list of all products.
		//2. Convert this list into a stream by calling the stream method.
		//3. Apply the mapToDouble operation to this stream. The operation should be applied to each Product object 
		//	 	in the stream, converting it into its price. Use the lambda expression product -> product.price to 
		//		perform this conversion. This expression means "for each product, return its price".
		//4. Apply the sum operation to the stream to get the total price of all products.
		//5. Store this total price in a double variable called priceTotal.
		//6. Print out priceTotal to the console to make sure you are properly summing your Products!
